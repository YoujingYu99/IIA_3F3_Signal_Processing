# IIA_3F3_Signal_Processing

This project is a short lab for the Cambridge Engineering IIA course 3F3 - Statistical Signal Processing. 

In this lab, we used the histogram method and the kernel density method to estimate a probability density from random samples.Moreover, three methods for the generation of non-uniformly distributed random numbers in Python are studied and some of the principal tricks involved in
generation from desired probability distributions are introduced. The methods include:


  * The Jacobian transformation of functions.
  * The inverse cumulative distribution function (CDF) method.
  * Generation from a scale mixture of normals representation.
  
Different distributions are also explored, namely the Gaussian distribution, the uniform distribution, the exponential distribution and the gamma distribution.
